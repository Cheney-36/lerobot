# @package _global_

# Use `act_koch_real.yaml` to train on real-world datasets collected on Alexander Koch's robots.
# Compared to `act.yaml`, it contains 2 cameras (i.e. laptop, phone) instead of 1 camera (i.e. top).
# Also, `training.eval_freq` is set to -1. This config is used to evaluate checkpoints at a certain frequency of training steps.
# When it is set to -1, it deactivates evaluation. This is because real-world evaluation is done through our `control_robot.py` script.
# Look at the documentation in header of `control_robot.py` for more information on how to collect data , train and evaluate a policy.
#
# Example of usage for training:
# ```bash
# python lerobot/scripts/train.py \
#   policy=act_koch_real \
#   env=koch_real
# ```
